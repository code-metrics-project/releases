Code Metrics is a system to help you gain deep insights into the quality of your codebase. It draws on metrics about your source code, your CI/CD pipeline and your tickets (such as bugs/defects).

At its core, Code Metrics provides a collection of whole project lifecycle code quality analysis tools. It enables you to combine sources to look for correlations, to answer questions over time such as:

- the bug to change ratio (related to change failure rate),
- which files are frequently implicated when bugs are fixed,
- how test coverage correlates to incidents,
- how complexity is changing with codebase size,
- how long pull requests take to review and merge,
- how much churn has there been in the codebase and
- custom combinations you create.
